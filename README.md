Fish Animation Game

This Java program represents a simple fish animation game where a player fish must avoid being eaten by background fish while growing in size by eating smaller fish. 

The player fish can be controlled using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
Background fish move across the screen with random sizes and speeds.
The game ends if the player fish is eaten by a larger background fish or if the player fish becomes too large.
